# Data-Analysis-IPL
A data analysis and data visualization project on IPL matches from the years 2008 to 2020 using pandas, NumPy and matplotlib library in python. 

The analysis is based on 2 datasets. Namely,

1) IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020.csv
   This dataset consists information of every ball bowled in IPL from 2008 to 2020. It consists information such as the batsmen that faced the delivery, the bowler which bowled the delivery and what happened after the ball was bowled such as a boundary or a wicket. 

2) IPL Matches 2008-2020.csv
   This dataset consists informaton about every match played from 2008 to 2020 in IPL. Information such as the two teams playing, the venue, toss winner, toss desicion, winner, winning margin, umpires etc.
   
Using these 2 dataframes for my analysis I have answered some of the most frequently asked question when IPL comes in mind. Such as the total runs scored in every season, number of 4's/6's in every seasons, best players, best teams and much more.

I used pandas, numpy and matplotlib libraries in python to do this project.
